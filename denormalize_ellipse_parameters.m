function [e] = denormalize_ellipse_parameters(ne,Hn)

% Input
% ne = ellipse parameters constructed using normalized points
% Hn = homography used to normalize the points

% Output
% e = denormalized ellipse parameters

e(1) = ne(1) / Hn(1,1);
e(2) = ne(2) / Hn(2,2);
e(3) = (ne(3) - Hn(1,3)) / Hn(1,1);
e(4) = (ne(4) - Hn(2,3)) / Hn(2,2);
e(5)=ne(5);
